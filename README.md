This code solves a project euler problem. Technically, users are prohibited
from posting solutions, so I've omitted the problem number, but the problem
text is in the comments at the top of `main.cpp`.

Most of the complexity is in performing the change of variables described in
the comments for `compute_candidate`, not the code itself. However, I'm quite
proud of  the algorithm for fast perfect square checking.
